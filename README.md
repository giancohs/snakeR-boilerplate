# Gianco's Data Project Boilerplate

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal boilerplate repository for initiating data-related projects, and focused in reproducibility using [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). This is tailored to my specific use case which predominantly involves the use of Python, R, and Quarto Notebooks. The folder structure is based on this [cookiecutter template](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).
